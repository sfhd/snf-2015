\noindent There will be at one extended meeting per academic year between the groups from Fribourg and G\"ottingen, as well as a yearly conference with international guests and fortnightly local meetings in Fribourg. Also, there will be further regular meetings between parts of the Fribourg and G\"ottingen groups based on ongoing collaborations of Kindt and K\"oppe who are both members of the `Arbeitsstelle f\"ur Theorie der Literatur' (G\"ottingen University) and of the network `Foundational Concepts of Narratology', as well as co-editors of the \emph{Journal of Literary Theory}. Finally, we will make extensive use of Skype, develop an online discussion forum and use similar means for weekly research exchanges.

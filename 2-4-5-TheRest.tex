\noindent There will be at one extended meeting per academic year between the groups from Fribourg and G\"ottingen, as well as a yearly conference with international guests and fortnightly local meetings in Fribourg. Also, there will be further regular meetings between parts of the Fribourg and G\"ottingen groups based on ongoing collaborations of Kindt and K\"oppe who are both members of the `Arbeitsstelle f\"ur Theorie der Literatur' (G\"ottingen University) and of the network `Foundational Concepts of Narratology', as well as co-editors of the \emph{Journal of Literary Theory}. Finally, we will make extensive use of Skype, develop an online discussion forum and use similar means for weekly research exchanges.

\textbf{2.5.  The Significance of the Research}
\vspace{.2cm}

Analyzing the norms that govern our imaginative involvement as well as the aesthetic appreciation that is based on this involvement promises to have an impact on both theoretical and practical aspects of literary studies. As to the theoretical side, it makes an important contribution to our understanding of the norms of literary interpretation (which is still at the heart of literary studies as conducted in academia), and hence contributes to the methodology of the discipline. Moreover, by focusing on the ways in which certain narrative structures can be said to guide our imaginings, we get a better understanding of these very structures --- especially since many of them must be taken to be response dependent properties of texts, thereby centrally involving the imagination. As to the practical side of literary studies, both Subproject 1 and Subproject 2 will enhance our understanding of certain prevalent interpretive disputes. (As a side effect, we also hope to gain a better understanding of `Der Sandmann' and other fictions under consideration.)
 
Since the German Department at G\"ottingen University offers an MA degree on the methodology of literary studies as well as a PhD program on the theory and methodology of textual studies more generally, the project will be closely intertwined with Tilmann K\"oppe's teaching practice in G\"ottingen.
 
Moreover, by centrally involving the notion of appreciation, both Subproject 1 and Subproject 2 bridge the gap between literary studies as an academic discipline and reading novels as conducted by the `layman'. While literary studies is often concerned with some more or less rigorous, `scientific' notion of analysis, it should turn to furthering our understanding of what makes literary fictions valuable to us -- or so we believe.
